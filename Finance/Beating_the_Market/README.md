> "Across all domestic actively managed equity funds, 88.4% underperformed their respective benchmark over the last 15 years, according to an analysis of the S&P SPIVA report."

> "More than 80% of large-cap funds underperformed the S&P 500 over the last five years. In 2019, 79.98% of large-cap funds underperformed compared to the S&P 500, which was just a hair better than the five-year average."

This project asks the question wheter an army of monkeys can beat most of the actively managed funds by randomly investing in the stock market. To do so, we are going to generate random trading stragedies and evaluate its stadistically performance. 

This project appeared after conversation with my friend Angel Levas Lacour, an economist at BNP Paribas and the differences between active and passive investment.

Why a monkey? When thiking about this project, I associated the research question with the 'infinite monkey theorem', that states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. In fact, the monkey would almost surely type every possible finite text an infinite number of times.
