  "initial_prompt": "Here's the revised prompt:\n\n\"I'm a nuanced sentiment analyzer. I'll carefully consider the entire context and content of the provided text to determine whether it expresses a predominantly positive or negative sentiment. When detecting irony, sarcasm, humor, or other forms of subtle expression, I'll analyze these nuances in depth, taking care not to be swayed by external associations or biases. My analysis will prioritize the overall tone and context, even when faced with mixed sentiments or contextual influences that might challenge me. In cases where strong negative descriptors like 'incoherent', 'unscary', or 'incompetently made' coexist with seemingly neutral or positive phrases, I'll give equal weight to both, ensuring a balanced evaluation of the sentiment. My classification will focus on the overall tone and context, taking into account any comparisons or references to other works that may impact my assessment.\"\n\nI've incorporated some key strategies from your analysis, including:\n\n* Emphasizing the importance of considering contextual influences\n* Prioritizing mixed sentiments and nuanced language use\n* Giving equal weight to both positive and negative descriptors when necessary\n* Focusing on overall tone and context in classification decisions\n\nThis revised prompt should help improve the model's accuracy and reduce false positives and false negatives.",
  "analysis": "After analyzing the misclassifications, I've identified specific examples where the model made mistakes and highlighted the elements of the text that may have led to the incorrect classification.\n\n**Incorrect Positive Classifications:**\n\n1. \"As a writer I find films this bad making it into production a complete slap in the face...\" (classified as a negative review)\n\t* Correct Classification: This should be classified as a neutral/negative review, but leaning more towards neutrality due to the tone being more frustrated than scathing.\n\t* Reason for misclassification: The model may have been overly sensitive to negative language and missed the nuanced tone of frustration, which is more characteristic of a neutral review.\n\n2. \"What starts out as a passable movie degenerates into one of the most incoherent...horror films of recent years.\" (classified as a strong negative review)\n\t* Correct Classification: This should be classified as a negative review, but with a tone that is more scathing and dismissive than some other reviews.\n\t* Reason for misclassification: The model may have missed the strength of the negative language used in this review, which suggests a stronger aversion to the movie.\n\n**Incorrect Negative Classifications:**\n\n1. \"The movie 'Heart of Darkness', based on the 1899 book by Joseph Conrad is one with little to no detail and has an almost schizophrenic like plot line.\" (classified as a strong negative review)\n\t* Correct Classification: This should be classified as a neutral/critical review, highlighting specific issues with the adaptation.\n\t* Reason for misclassification: The model may have been overly sensitive to criticism and missed the nuanced tone of this review, which is more characteristic of a critical review than a scathing one.\n\n2. \"What starts out as a passable movie degenerates into one of the most incoherent...horror films of recent years.\" (classified as a strong negative review)\n\t* Correct Classification: This should be classified as a neutral/negative review, with a tone that is more dismissive than scathing.\n\t* Reason for misclassification: The model may have missed the strength of the negative language used in this review and instead focused on its overall negativity.\n\n**Strategies to Improve Classification Prompt:**\n\n1. **Increase nuance sensitivity**: Update the prompt to better recognize subtle differences between neutral, critical, and strong negative reviews.\n2. **Improve handling of idiomatic expressions**: The model should be able to handle idiomatic expressions like \"slap in the face\" or \"complete failure\" without misclassifying them as overly negative.\n3. **Reduce over-sensitivity to negative language**: Adjust the prompt to account for nuances in tone, such as frustration vs. scathing criticism, and avoid over-classifying reviews as strong negatives.\n4. **Enhance understanding of neutral/critical reviews**: Improve the model's ability to distinguish between neutral and critical reviews, especially when highlighting specific issues with a movie or book.\n5. **Consider adding a \"mixed\" category**: Introduce a new classification category for reviews that contain both positive and negative statements, acknowledging the complexity of human opinions.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, the classification prompt can better recognize the nuances in text and reduce false positives and false negatives, providing more accurate results.",
