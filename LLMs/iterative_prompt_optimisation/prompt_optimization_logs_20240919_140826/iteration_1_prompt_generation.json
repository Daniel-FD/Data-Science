  "initial_prompt": "You are a sentiment analysis classifier. Determine whether the provided text expresses a positive sentiment.",
  "analysis": "After analyzing the misclassifications, I've identified some common patterns and provided insights into why these errors occurred.\n\n**Negative (0) texts (incorrectly classified as positive)**\n\n1. **\"Shuttle\" review**: This review is actually a negative one, but the model incorrectly classified it as positive because of phrases like \"I think even God would say, 'Good call.'\" and \"'Shuttle' was a decent film.\" The model seems to have focused on these isolated positive statements rather than considering the overall tone and content of the review.\n\nWhy this error occurred: The model may be too sensitive to individual sentences or phrases that contain positive words, without taking into account the context in which they are used. This can lead to false positives when the text is actually negative but contains some redeeming qualities.\n\n2. **\"Dragon Hunt\" review**: Despite calling it \"one of the cheapest action flicks of the eighties,\" this reviewer still enjoys watching it as a guilty pleasure or party tape. The model may have misinterpreted the tone, thinking that the reviewer's enthusiasm for the movie's absurdity means they genuinely enjoy it.\n\nWhy this error occurred: The model might be too quick to classify texts based on surface-level positive statements without considering the nuances of tone and intent. In this case, the reviewer is being facetious or ironic when praising the movie.\n\n3. **\"What the World Needs to Know About Islam\" review**: This scathing review highlights the film's poor production values and lack of journalistic integrity. The model should have classified it as a negative review based on its harsh language.\n\nWhy this error occurred: The model may be too focused on identifying obvious positive or negative keywords, without considering the overall sentiment and impact of the text.\n\n4. **\"Clonus\" review**: This reviewer calls the film \"mediocre\" and \"crappy,\" but mentions that it's better than some other films they've seen on MST3K. The model incorrectly classified this as a positive review because of the mention of MST3K, which is often associated with humorous or entertaining content.\n\nWhy this error occurred: The model may be too influenced by external associations or biases, rather than evaluating the text based on its inherent value and sentiment.\n\nCorrect classifications for these examples:\n\n* \"Shuttle\" review: Negative\n* \"Dragon Hunt\" review: Negative (with a hint of irony or sarcasm)\n* \"What the World Needs to Know About Islam\" review: Negative\n* \"Clonus\" review: Negative\n\n**Strategies to improve the classification prompt**\n\n1. **Contextualize individual statements**: Train the model to consider the overall context and tone of the text, rather than focusing solely on individual sentences or phrases.\n2. **Account for nuances in tone and intent**: Develop strategies to detect irony, sarcasm, or other forms of nuanced language that can be misinterpreted by simple keyword-based approaches.\n3. **Increase sensitivity to subtle differences**: Tune the model to recognize smaller-scale variations in sentiment and classification, rather than relying on binary thresholds.\n4. **Reduce external bias and associations**: Implement techniques to mitigate biases stemming from external factors, such as cultural or contextual influences.\n5. **Consider a more granular classification framework**: Instead of relying solely on positive/negative labels, consider implementing a multi-classification system that accounts for degrees of sentiment (e.g., negative, neutral, positive).\n\nBy addressing these issues and incorporating the recommended strategies, you can improve the accuracy of your LLM model's binary classifications.",
  "new_prompt": "Here is the rewritten prompt:\n\n\"I'm a nuanced sentiment analyzer. I'll carefully consider the overall tone and context of the provided text to determine whether it expresses a predominantly positive or negative sentiment, acknowledging subtle variations in language and avoiding biases stemming from external associations. I'll also be sensitive to nuances like irony, sarcasm, or humor that can influence my interpretation.\""
