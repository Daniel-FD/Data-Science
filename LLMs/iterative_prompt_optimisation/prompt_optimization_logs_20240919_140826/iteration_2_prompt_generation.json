  "analysis": "**Analysis**\n\nThe LLM model misclassified several texts as either positive or negative, when in fact they belonged to the opposite category. By examining each example, we can identify specific elements that may have led to these errors.\n\n**False Positives (Incorrectly classified as Positive)**\n\n1. **\"Avoid this bomb like it will infect you with an STD.\"**: This text was incorrectly classified as a positive review.\n\t* Why: The model likely focused on the phrase \"a 5'2 105 lb woman of course has the strength to kill men and women twice her size without a struggle and in a single blow\" which could be seen as humorous or satirical, rather than criticizing the movie's writing.\n\t* Correct Classification: Negative review\n2. **\"What starts out as a passable movie degenerates into one of the most incoherent, UNscary, incompetently made, stupid attempted horror films of recent years.\"**: This text was incorrectly classified as a positive review.\n\t* Why: The model may have missed the strong negative adjectives used to describe the movie, such as \"incoherent\", \"UNscary\", and \"incompetently made\".\n\t* Correct Classification: Negative review\n3. **\"As a writer I find films this bad making it into production a complete slap in the face.\"**: This text was incorrectly classified as a positive review.\n\t* Why: The model may have focused on the phrase \"making it into production a complete slap in the face\", which could be seen as a neutral or even slightly positive sentiment, rather than the overall negative tone of the text.\n\t* Correct Classification: Negative review\n\n**False Negatives (Incorrectly classified as Negative)**\n\n1. **\"The idea ia a very short film with a lot of information.\"**: This text was incorrectly classified as a negative review.\n\t* Why: The model likely focused on the phrase \"a very short film with a lot of information\", which could be seen as a positive aspect, rather than criticizing the movie's quality or impact.\n\t* Correct Classification: Positive review\n2. **\"The producer has produced a short film of excellent quality that cannot be compared to any other short film that I have seen.\"**: This text was incorrectly classified as a negative review.\n\t* Why: The model may have missed the strong positive adjectives used to describe the movie, such as \"excellent quality\".\n\t* Correct Classification: Positive review\n\n**Insights and Recommendations**\n\nThe errors in classification highlight several challenges with the current prompt:\n\n1. **Limited contextual understanding**: The model struggles to understand the nuances of context, leading to misinterpretation of phrases or sentences.\n2. **Lack of subtlety recognition**: The model may not be able to recognize subtle differences between positive and negative sentiments, especially when they are presented in a complex or humorous manner.\n3. **Insufficient emphasis on negative adjectives**: The model may focus too heavily on positive language, ignoring or downplaying negative adjectives that can indicate a negative review.\n\nTo improve the classification prompt and reduce both false positives and false negatives, we recommend the following strategies:\n\n1. **Increase contextual understanding**: Implement techniques such as named entity recognition (NER), part-of-speech tagging, or dependency parsing to better understand the context in which words and phrases are used.\n2. **Improve subtlety recognition**: Train the model to recognize subtle differences between positive and negative sentiments, especially when they are presented in a complex or humorous manner.\n3. **Emphasize negative adjectives**: Place more emphasis on recognizing and analyzing negative adjectives, such as \"incoherent\", \"UNscary\", or \"incompetently made\".\n4. **Enhance sentiment analysis**: Implement advanced sentiment analysis techniques, such as aspect-based sentiment analysis or emotion recognition, to better capture the nuances of human sentiment.\n5. **Fine-tune the prompt**: Adjust the classification prompt to focus more on specific aspects that contribute to a positive or negative review, rather than relying solely on general sentiment analysis.\n\nBy addressing these challenges and implementing the recommended strategies, we can improve the accuracy of text classification and provide users with more reliable information about movie reviews.",
  "new_prompt": "Here's the revised prompt:\n\n\"I'm a nuanced sentiment analyzer. I'll carefully consider the entire context and content of the provided text to determine whether it expresses a predominantly positive or negative sentiment. When detecting irony, sarcasm, humor, or other forms of subtle expression, I'll analyze these nuances in depth, taking care not to be swayed by external associations or biases. In evaluating sentiment, I'll give equal weight to both positive and negative adjectives, ensuring that the presence of strong negative descriptors like 'incoherent', 'UNscary', or 'incompetently made' doesn't get overshadowed by seemingly neutral or positive phrases. My analysis will prioritize the overall tone and context, providing an accurate classification even in cases where subtle variations in language may challenge me.\""
