  "initial_prompt": "You are a sentiment analysis classifier. Determine whether the provided text expresses a positive sentiment.",
  "analysis": "**Analysis of Misclassifications**\n\nAfter analyzing the misclassified texts, I identified specific examples where the model made mistakes.\n\n**Negative (0) texts incorrectly classified as positive:**\n\n1. **Example:** \"I hate guns and have never murdered anyone... But when even half of the events that take place in 'Shuttle' happen to you or close ones and you find a gun, YOU SHOOT YOUR ATTACKER.\"\n\n**Incorrect Classification:** Positive\n\n**Correct Classification:** Negative (0)\n\n**Analysis:** The model incorrectly classified this text as positive because it mentioned enjoyment of a horror movie despite some flaws. However, the strong language used (\"I hate guns\", \"YOU SHOOT YOUR ATTACKER\") and the context of a violent scene suggest a negative sentiment towards violence.\n\n2. **Example:** \"...it would've served the audience better with roughly 15-20 minutes deleted... I would recommend if you have almost 2 hours to kill and are into sick horror.\"\n\n**Incorrect Classification:** Positive\n\n**Correct Classification:** Negative (0)\n\n**Analysis:** Although the text ends with a recommendation, it highlights several negative aspects of the movie, such as clich\u00e9s, foreshadowing, and poor pacing. The model should have given more weight to these criticisms.\n\n3. **Example:** \"...the most annoying part was the revelation towards the closing from one best friend to the other.\"\n\n**Incorrect Classification:** Positive\n\n**Correct Classification:** Negative (0)\n\n**Analysis:** This sentence expresses frustration with a plot twist, which indicates a negative sentiment.\n\n**Positives (1) texts incorrectly classified as negative:**\n\nNone provided. It seems that there were no misclassified positive texts.\n\n**Insights and Recommendations**\n\nBased on these analyses, I recommend the following strategies to improve the classification prompt:\n\n1. **Weigh stronger language:** Give more weight to strong language (e.g., \"I hate guns\") when classifying negative sentiments.\n2. **Consider context:** Analyze the text's overall tone and context, rather than just focusing on isolated sentences or phrases.\n3. **Identify nuances:** Train the model to recognize subtle differences between positive and negative sentiments, such as the distinction between enjoyment of a movie despite flaws versus strong language expressing disdain for violence.\n4. **Use multiple cues:** Incorporate additional features or signals into the classification prompt, such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or entity recognition, to improve accuracy.\n5. **Fine-tune the model:** Update the model with more data and fine-tune it to better recognize nuances in language.\n\n**Improved Classification Prompt**\n\nTo address these issues, I suggest an updated classification prompt that incorporates multiple cues and nuances:\n\n* **Input:** Text (full text)\n* **Features:**\n\t+ Sentiment analysis (positive/negative/neutral)\n\t+ Topic modeling (movie reviews, entertainment, etc.)\n\t+ Entity recognition (people, places, events, etc.)\n* **Weights:**\n\t+ Strong language (e.g., \"hate\") given higher weight in negative sentiment classification\n\t+ Contextual analysis prioritized for accurate classification\n\nBy implementing these strategies and updates, the classification prompt can better recognize the nuances that led to the errors and reduce both false positives and false negatives.",
  "new_prompt": "Here's a revised prompt that incorporates the recommended strategies:\n\n**You are a nuanced sentiment analysis classifier. Classify the provided text as either positive (1) or negative (0), giving higher weight to strong language and contextual analysis while considering multiple cues.**\n\nThis prompt is designed to guide the model to handle difficult or edge cases by incorporating the following features:\n\n* **Strong language:** By using the phrase \"strong language\" in the prompt, you're indicating that the model should prioritize words or phrases with a high emotional intensity (e.g., \"hate\", \"loath\", \"detest\") when classifying negative sentiments.\n* **Contextual analysis:** The prompt encourages the model to analyze the text's overall tone and context, rather than just focusing on isolated sentences or phrases.\n* **Multiple cues:** By mentioning multiple cues, such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and entity recognition, you're guiding the model to consider various signals when making its classification decision.\n\nThis revised prompt should help improve the accuracy of binary classification by reducing both false positives and false negatives."
