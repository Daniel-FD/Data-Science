       "<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">│</span> 5. **Consider adding a \"mixed\" category**: Introduce a new classification category for reviews that contain     <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">│</span>\n",

       "<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">│</span> 1. **Increase nuance sensitivity**: Update the prompt to better recognize subtle differences between neutral,   <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">│</span>\n",

       "<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">│</span> 5. **Consider adding a \"mixed\" category**: Introduce a new classification category for reviews that contain     <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">│</span>\n",
