  "analysis": "**Analysis of Misclassifications**\n\nUpon analyzing the provided texts, I've identified specific examples where the LLM model made mistakes.\n\n**False Positives (Negative texts incorrectly classified as positive)**\n\n1. **Example 1**: \"I hate guns and have never murdered anyone...\" This text starts with a strong negative sentiment towards violence, but then describes a hypothetical situation where the protagonist would kill their attacker. However, this scenario is portrayed in a way that suggests it's justified or even desirable. The model might have misinterpreted the tone of this passage, mistaking it for a positive review due to its enthusiastic language and use of phrases like \"Good call\" and \"'Hostel'-type film.\" **Correct classification:** Negative\n\n2. **Example 2**: \"I have seen this movie several times, it sure is one of the cheapest action flicks of the eighties.\" This text starts with a clear negative statement about the movie's quality but ends by recommending it as \"great trash\" for those who enjoy cheap action movies. The model might have misjudged the tone and focused on the phrase \"great party tape!\" which could be perceived as positive. **Correct classification:** Negative\n\n3. **Example 3**: This film is a mediocre, low-budget flick... This text is straightforward in its negative assessment of the movie. However, it also mentions that the MST3K version was \"priceless; one of the best episodes ever.\" The model might have misinterpreted this as an endorsement of the original film itself instead of the parody episode. **Correct classification:** Negative\n\n**Insights and Strategies to Improve Classification**\n\n1.  **Improve tone detection**: Develop a more nuanced understanding of tone, particularly for texts that express strong opinions or emotions.\n2.  **Contextualize phrases and sentences**: Recognize when a single phrase or sentence might be misinterpreted in isolation, and consider the context in which it appears.\n3.  **Avoid overreliance on individual words**: Instead, focus on the overall sentiment expressed by a text, even if that means considering multiple sentences or phrases.\n4.  **Weighting factors for tone and content**: Consider developing a weighting system to account for different factors that influence sentiment classification, such as the strength of opinions, emotional language, or contextual clues.\n\n**Correct Classification Recommendations**\n\n1.  **Example 1**: This text should be classified as Negative due to its overall negative sentiment towards violence.\n2.  **Example 2**: This text should also be classified as Negative because it explicitly states that the movie is a \"cheap\" and low-quality film, even though it's recommended for those who enjoy such movies.\n3.  **Example 3**: Similarly, this text should be classified as Negative due to its overall negative assessment of the original film.\n\n**Improved Prompt Strategies**\n\n1.  **Incorporate contextual information**: Encourage users to provide additional context about their reviews, such as their expectations or the type of movie they were watching.\n2.  **Use more nuanced sentiment labels**: Instead of using binary positive/negative labels, consider using a three- or four-tiered system that captures varying levels of positivity and negativity (e.g., very negative, somewhat negative, neutral, etc.).\n3.  **Account for sarcasm and irony**: Develop strategies to detect when users are being sarcastic or ironic in their reviews, which can significantly impact the accuracy of sentiment classification.\n\nBy implementing these strategies and refining the prompt to better capture subtle differences in text, we should be able to reduce false positives and false negatives and improve the overall accuracy of our binary classification model.",

Consider potential sarcasm, irony, or strong opinions that might influence your classification.\""
