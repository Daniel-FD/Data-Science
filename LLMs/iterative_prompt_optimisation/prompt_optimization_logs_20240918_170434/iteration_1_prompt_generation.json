  "analysis": "**Analysis of Misclassifications**\n\nThe two sets of texts exhibit a complex sentiment, making them challenging for the sentiment analysis model. Here's a breakdown of the false positives (incorrectly classified as positive) and false negatives (incorrectly classified as negative):\n\n**False Positives:**\n\n1. The first text appears to be mixed in tone, with both positive and negative comments. However, upon closer examination, the writer seems to appreciate the movie \"Shuttle\" despite its flaws, which might have led the model to incorrectly classify it as positive.\n2. In the second text, the author explicitly states that the movie \"Dragon Hunt\" is \"really awful\" but then qualifies it by saying it's a great party tape. The model might have misinterpreted this nuanced sentiment and classified it as positive.\n\n**False Negatives:**\n\nThere are no texts provided for false negatives.\n\n**Insights on Why Misclassifications Might Have Occurred:**\n\n1. **Tone ambiguity**: Both texts contain mixed tones, making it difficult for the model to accurately classify them.\n2. **Contextual understanding**: The model might have struggled to understand the context in which certain words or phrases were used. For example, the writer's sarcastic tone in the first text or their ironic appreciation of \"Dragon Hunt\" in the second.\n3. **Linguistic complexity**: The texts use colloquial expressions, sarcasm, and irony, which can be challenging for language models to grasp.\n\n**Strategies to Improve Classification Prompt:**\n\n1. **Improve contextual understanding**: Train the model on more nuanced examples of sentiment, including texts with mixed tones or ambiguous emotions.\n2. **Enhance linguistic complexity handling**: Incorporate training data that includes colloquial expressions, sarcasm, and irony to help the model better understand these complexities.\n3. **Increase robustness to ambiguity**: Develop strategies to handle situations where text meanings are unclear or context-dependent, such as using multiple models or integrating human feedback into the classification process.\n4. **Use more advanced NLP techniques**: Explore the use of techniques like sentiment analysis with attention mechanisms, hierarchical or multi-layered models, and graph-based approaches to better capture complex sentiments.\n5. **Regularly update and fine-tune the model**: Continuously retrain the model on new data to improve its performance and adapt it to changing language usage patterns.\n\nBy addressing these challenges and implementing strategies to improve contextual understanding, linguistic complexity handling, and robustness to ambiguity, you can enhance the accuracy of your sentiment analysis model.",
  "new_prompt": "**Revised Prompt**\n\nYou are a sentiment analysis classifier trained on nuanced examples of sentiment, including texts with mixed tones and ambiguous emotions. You can handle colloquial expressions, sarcasm, and irony.\n\nClassify the provided text as '1' if it expresses a positive sentiment about a movie review, or '0' if it expresses a negative sentiment. If the sentiment is mixed or ambiguous, classify it based on the tone that dominates the text.\n\nDo NOT answer anything else.You are to act as a binary responder. For every question asked, reply strictly with '1' for positive or '0' for negative. Do NOT include any additional text or explanation."
