  "initial_prompt": "Here's the refined prompt:\n\n\"I'm searching for subtle clues in the text. Classify it as 1 (positive) if it conveys enthusiasm, excitement, or approval about a movie, product, or experience, and explicitly mentions its plot, characters, settings, or features. However, classify it as 0 (negative) if it expresses criticism, dissatisfaction, or negativity towards an entity, even with caveats or qualifications, especially when characterized by rhetorical questions, emotive language, personal attacks, and explicit criticism. Be cautious of false positives in reviews; prioritize the presence of objective statements, balanced evaluations, and detailed analysis. If the text appears to be a rant or complaint, pay attention to its tone, structure, and author's purpose. Specifically, consider whether the text mentions specific plot points, character interactions, or settings that align with the genre (e.g., action movie), and take note of any requests for release, restoration, or improvement related to an old movie or entity.\"",
  "analysis": "**Analysis of Misclassifications**\n\nThe provided texts demonstrate a range of misclassifications, including:\n\n1. **Negative texts classified as positive:**\n\t* Example 1 (Movie Review): The text describes a movie as \"one of the cheapest action flicks of the eighties\" and states it's \"really awful,\" but also mentions it's a \"great party tape.\" The model incorrectly classified this review as positive, likely due to the tone being more playful and humorous than negative.\n\t* Example 2 (Sequel Review): This text discusses a movie that didn't live up to expectations, stating it's \"not a bad film\" but also mentions it's \"like most sequels.\" The model misclassified this review as positive, possibly due to the reviewer's lukewarm tone and emphasis on its family-friendly nature.\n2. **Positive texts classified as negative:**\n\t* Example 3 (Movie Review): This text discusses a movie with a ridiculous plot, bad dialogue, and silly characters, but also highlights its entertaining aspects, such as suspense and action sequences. The model incorrectly classified this review as negative, likely due to the focus on the movie's flaws rather than its enjoyable qualities.\n\t* Example 4 (Historical Context Complaint): This text expresses disappointment with Paramount Pictures' handling of a historical movie, criticizing their restoration efforts and lack of recognition for a real pirate who lived in New Orleans. The model misclassified this complaint as negative, possibly due to the tone being more critical than positive.\n\n**Correct Classifications**\n\nFor each example:\n\n1. **Example 1**: Correct classification should be Negative (0)\n2. **Example 2**: Correct classification should be Positive (1) with a nuance: it's a mediocre movie that didn't live up to expectations, but still enjoyable for some.\n3. **Example 3**: Correct classification should be Positive (1), highlighting the movie's entertaining aspects and flaws as a sign of its campy appeal.\n4. **Example 4**: Correct classification should be Negative (0), emphasizing the complainant's disappointment with Paramount Pictures' handling of a historical movie.\n\n**Strategies to Improve Classification Prompt**\n\nTo reduce false positives and false negatives, consider the following adjustments:\n\n1. **Tone Analysis**: Incorporate tone analysis techniques into the prompt to better capture the nuances of language. This can help distinguish between playful or humorous texts that are still negative and those that genuinely express enthusiasm.\n2. **Emphasis on Specifics**: Encourage the model to focus on specific details in the text, such as plot elements, character development, or historical context. This can help identify whether a review is primarily positive or negative.\n3. **Contextual Understanding**: Add contextual understanding to the prompt by incorporating information about the movie's genre, target audience, and release date. This can help the model recognize that a negative review might still be enjoyable for some viewers.\n4. **Sentiment Polarity**: Refine the sentiment polarity analysis in the prompt to account for subtle differences between positive and negative sentiments. This can involve identifying nuance in language, such as using words like \"awful\" versus \"bad.\"\n5. **Regular Training Data Updates**: Regularly update the training data with new texts that reflect different genres, styles, and linguistic variations. This will help ensure the model remains accurate and adaptable to changing language patterns.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies into the classification prompt, you can improve its accuracy in recognizing the nuances of language and reduce false positives and false negatives.",
