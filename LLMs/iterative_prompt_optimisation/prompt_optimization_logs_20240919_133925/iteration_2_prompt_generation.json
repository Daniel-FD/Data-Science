  "analysis": "After analyzing the misclassifications, I've identified specific examples where the model made mistakes and highlighted what elements of the text may have led to these errors.\n\n**Example 1: Misclassified as a review of \"The Expendables\" film**\n\n* Error: The text was classified as a movie review instead of a rant or complaint.\n* Specific example: The sentence \"DO THESE GANGSTERS WANT THEIR MONEY FETCHED OR NOT???\" is a clear indication that the author is frustrated and annoyed with the plot, rather than providing a neutral or positive review.\n* Correct classification: Rant or Complaint\n* Analysis: The text's tone, language, and structure suggest a complaint rather than a review. The use of rhetorical questions, sarcastic comments, and excessive criticism point to an emotional response, not a balanced evaluation.\n\n**Example 2: Misclassified as a movie review**\n\n* Error: The text was classified as a movie review instead of a rant or complaint.\n* Specific example: The sentence \"I have no idea what drugs he was on when he did it\" suggests the author's strong negative emotions towards the film, rather than providing an objective review.\n* Correct classification: Rant or Complaint\n* Analysis: Similar to Example 1, the text's tone and language indicate a complaint rather than a review. The use of emotive language, personal attacks (e.g., \"I'd hate to think the script is this bad because of a low I.Q.\"), and explicit criticism point to an emotional response.\n\n**Example 3: Misclassified as a movie review**\n\n* Error: The text was classified as a movie review instead of a rant or complaint.\n* Specific example: The sentence \"Paramount Pictures it is up to you to get off your duff and get this film restored now!\" suggests the author's strong emotions towards the company's handling of the film, rather than providing an objective review.\n* Correct classification: Rant or Complaint\n* Analysis: This text shares similarities with Examples 1 and 2. The use of rhetorical questions, emotive language, and explicit criticism point to a complaint rather than a review.\n\n**Strategies to improve the classification prompt**\n\nTo reduce both false positives (classifying reviews as rants/complaints) and false negatives (missing actual rants/complaints), consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Improve sentiment analysis**: Develop more nuanced sentiment analysis techniques that can distinguish between strong emotions expressed in a review (e.g., excitement, disappointment) and those expressed in a rant or complaint (e.g., frustration, anger).\n2. **Increase emphasis on tone**: Weight the classification prompt towards recognizing the tone of the text. For example, use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify phrases or sentences with strong emotional connotations.\n3. **Enhance contextual understanding**: Incorporate contextual information into the classification process, such as:\n\t* Identifying the author's purpose: Is the author reviewing a movie or expressing dissatisfaction?\n\t* Recognizing the text structure: Are the criticisms organized in a logical manner or presented in a scattered fashion?\n4. **Use more specific keywords**: Update the keyword list to include phrases and words associated with rants/complaints, such as \"I'm so disappointed,\" \"This is ridiculous,\" or \"They completely messed up.\"\n5. **Reduce false positives by emphasizing review characteristics**: When classifying text as a movie review, prioritize the presence of objective statements, balanced evaluations, and detailed analysis of the film.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies, you can improve the accuracy of text classification and reduce both false positives and false negatives.",
  "new_prompt": "Here's the revised prompt:\n\n\"I'm looking for subtle clues in the text. If it expresses an overall tone of enthusiasm, excitement, or approval, classify it as 1 (positive). However, if it conveys criticism, dissatisfaction, or negativity, even if tempered with caveats or qualifications, especially when characterized by rhetorical questions, emotive language, personal attacks, and explicit criticism, classify it as 0 (negative). Be cautious of false positives in reviews; prioritize the presence of objective statements, balanced evaluations, and detailed analysis. If the text appears to be a rant or complaint, pay attention to its tone, structure, and author's purpose.\""
