Sucess criteria:
1. The client is centered, in the middle of the photo
2. The client is looking straight into the camera lens.
3. The photo is taken straight in front of the client, (the right and left sides of the client are symmetrical, and the camera was at the same height as the frame to avoid taking the photo from an upper or lower angle).
4. The photo is taken from a distance of 40cm.
5. The measuring frame needs to be in a comfortable position for the client. The same way he plans to wear the loupes.
6. The measuring frame’s temples need to sit on the client’s ears, and not float above them.
7. The nose pads of the measuring frame need to be in a neutral position and similar to each other.
8. I need to receive the original photo and not a cropped version, also do not zoom in when taking the photo.

Solution:
1. Oval in the middle of the photo.
2. Screen instructions.
3. Two angle criterias: vertical angle and horizonal angle - that prevents horizontal and vertical tiltling.
4. Not possible to do by image processing techniques. Focal lenght of the camera and camera calibration would be required.
5. Screen instructions.
6. Screen instructions.
7. Screen instructions.
8. Screen instructions. Photo taken directly from the application - which prevents cropping or unoriginal photos.
